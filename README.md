# Flask Production Docker Container

## What is this...

I experiment a lot so I needed an easy way to get [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) applications ready for more production like environments.

## AWS

Since I use a lot of [AWS Services](https://aws.amazon.com), especially [Cognito for user authentication](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/), I have updated this project to reflect that integration.

## Deployment

The Docker image will be made available in the public Docker repository... `TODO`

# Usage

Coming shortly...
